# CyanoB_Agg_Frag
This folder contains scripts for the investigation of aggregation/fragmentation of cyanobaterial colonies under strong shear. Two scripts are available:

•	CyanoB_Image_Analysis: This image processing routine detects colonies from images of a suspension of cyanobacteria under shear and calculates the statistical descriptors of the population over time.

•	CyanoB_Model: This routine simulates the time evolution of a caynobacteria suspension under aggregation/breakage

•	If you have any questions, please contact me with y.z.sinzato@uva.nl or m.jalaal@uva.nl
