	Description:
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Routine to simulate the dynamics of Microcystis colony formation under:
 - Uniform homogeneous turbulent shear flow carachterized by tubulent dissipation rate epsilon and kinematic viscosity nu
 - No cell division
 - Aggregation is also turbulent driven, with a stickness coeficient alpha. Model described in "Burd and Jackson, 2009, Particle Aggregation"
 - Break-up driven by erosion - Double population model, adapted from Babler 2008
 - Colony size distribution described by frequency as a function of radius n(r) and mass fraction (mass-weighted distribution n_m(r))
 - Solution by classes method (discritized distribution function)
 - Two population kinds: division-formed colonies, with large critical size, and aggregation-formed colonies, with small critical size

	Instructions:
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 - Open a Linux shell in main folder and compile .f90 code with command :  gfortran Numerical_Model/agg_bre.f90 -o Numerical_Model/agg_bre.exe -g -fcheck=all
 - Give parameters in the text file 'Temporary/parameters.txt'
 - Give initial size distribution in the text file 'Temporary/csd_initial.txt'
 - Run executable 'agg_bre.exe' in WSL Ubuntu terminal
 - Results are writen in 'Temporary/csd_data.txt' and 'Temporary/r_data.txt'
